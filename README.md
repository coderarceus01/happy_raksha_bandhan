# Happy Raksha Bandhan — Shareable Card (Static)

This is a simple static site that lets you create a shareable Raksha Bandhan greeting card.
The customization (name, followers, message, background image) is passed in the URL query string so you can share a single link.

## Files
- `index.html` — main page
- `styles.css` — styling
- `script.js` — logic to read/write URL params and update preview
- `README.md` — this file

## How to use locally
1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or use a simple server).
2. Fill in Name / Followers / Message and click **Generate Share Link**.
3. Copy the link and share — opening it will render the card with your customization.

## Deploy
This site can be deployed as a static site:
- GitHub Pages (push the project to a repo and enable Pages on `main` branch)
- Netlify: drag & drop the folder in Netlify's "Sites" area or connect the GitHub repo.

See the instructions provided in the companion message for step-by-step deployment to GitHub and Netlify.
